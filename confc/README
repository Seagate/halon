This folder contains the Haskell package confc. It defines the bindings for
Mero configuration client library.

The Mero configuration client library allows programs to contact the confd
service.

This package requires "network-transport-rpc" package as a dependency.

    $ make test

If the diff command performed by make is silent the test result is good.
