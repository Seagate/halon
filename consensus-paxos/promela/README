The files in this folder provide a Promela model of the consensus-paxos
implementation which can be verified with spin.

To run a random simulation type:
make prom
To verify the model type:
make verify
To load the model in the ispin graphical tool type:
make ispin

Part of the promela code is extracted from the Haskell source files by using
the commentExtrator.hs script. For help using this script type:
runhaskell commentExtrator.hs
