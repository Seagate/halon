-- An implementation of a pool of processes with keys.
--
-- This pool is useful for network IO tasks. Send operations in d-p are blocking
-- if the send buffers are full. When multiple messages are sent to the same
-- node, it doesn't make sense to spawn one process per message. It is enough to
-- spawn one process per destination node, and have this process send all the
-- messages to the node. This process gets a key that can be used to submit
-- tasks to it. In this case the key could be the 'NodeId'.
--
-- Thus, each message which needs to be sent to a node, motivates a task
-- submitted to the pool with the node address as key.
--
-- When a connection failure is detected it doesn't make sense to block on all
-- the queued tasks for the unreachable node, in which case the process can be
-- terminated and the task queue can be cleared.

-- | A pool of worker processes that execute tasks.
--
-- Each worker process is named with a key @k@. Tasks are submitted to a
-- specific worker using its key. While the worker is busy the tasks are queued.
-- When there are no more queued tasks the worker ceases to exist.
--
-- The next time a task is submitted the worker will be respawned.
--
newtype ProcessPool k = ProcessPool (IORef (Map.Map k (Maybe (Process ()))))

-- Each worker has an entry in the map with a closure that contains all
-- queued actions fot it.
--
-- No entry in the map is kept for defunct workers.

-- | Creates a pool with no workers.

newProcessPool = fmap ProcessPool $ liftIO $ newIORef Map.empty

-- | @submitTask pool k task@ submits a task for the worker @k@.
--
-- If worker @k@ is busy, then @submitTask@ yields @Nothing@ and the task is
-- queued until the worker is available.
--
-- If worker @k@ does not exist, then @submitTask@ yields @Just proc@ where
-- @proc@ is the computation that will execute the task and possibly other tasks
-- submitted later. Callers will likely want to run @proc@ in a newly spawned
-- process.
--
-- A task which returns with an exception terminates the worker and causes the
-- queue for @k@ to be cleared.
