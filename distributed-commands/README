distributed-commands tests are not built/run by default in non-rpc mode.

Environmental setup for tests:
* you need digital ocean credentials set in the environment
  get these from Google Drive in a file called "Access Tokens"
        export DO_CLIENT_ID=...
        export DO_API_KEY=...
* you need ssh key that is known to the droplet test snapshot - ask
   someone like @facundo to give you such an ssh key

To build and run the tests:
in halon/ root directory, after building halon ok, do this:

 cabal install --enable-tests --run-tests --flag="distributed-tests" --reinstall distributed-command

This command will build distributed-commands and run the tests
against Digital Ocean.

If the tests fail or you kill them part way, you might find some
processes left behind without a parent; these processes
(for example, scp) might cause subsequent attempts to run the
tests to fail by occupying port localhost:4000. Kill them manually.
