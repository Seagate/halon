-- Interface serving as a communication shim between services and RC.
--
-- The idea is to unify the set of possible messages into a union and
-- have a single place where the communication implementation lives
-- for a service. This allows for further hiding of any extra details
-- such as version exchanges and updates from the rest of the service
-- code.

--   least it should be!). That gives other handlers a chance to
--   remove the message from mailbox before this function runs again.
