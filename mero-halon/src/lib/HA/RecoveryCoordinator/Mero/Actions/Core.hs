--
-- For the commands that are required to be used in mero thread (mero-commands)
-- Recovery coordinator is using dedicated thread contolled by MeroWorker (see
-- mero worker). This is done in order to not block global mero thread.
--
-- All mero calls are scheduled in the queue, so it's guaranteed that order will
-- be preserved and actions will not overlap. However calls may be synchronious
-- or asynchronous in a sence that if they block Recovery Coordinator or not.
--
--   * [synchronous call] - low overhead call to mero thread, this call avoids
--      creation of the new helper threads and results serialization. However
--      RC thread will be blocked until call will exit. This call doesn't
--      require creation on additional phases and can be executed in 'PhaseM'
--      directly. Synchronous calls rethrow  possible exceptions as-is in the
--      RC thread.
--
--      Synchronous calls should be used only for the fast non-blocking calls.
--
--   * [asynchronous calls] - higher overhead calls to mero thread. Such calls
--      create helper D-P Process that will handle reply from mero and re-send
--      it to RC, so serialization is used. In order to handle reply additional
--      phase have to be introduced.
--
--      Asynchronous calls can be used for any kind of calls but at a cost of
--      performance and mainly maintenance and code support overhead.
--
--  As all calls are queued it's imporant that using synchronous call after
--  any asynchronous call will block RC thread until previous async call will
--  exit.
--
--  @
--  m0asynchronous >> m0asynchronous
--  @
--
--  will immediately exit and notifications will be received in the future point
--  of time.
--
--  @
--  m0asynchronous >> m0synchronous
--  @
--
--  will block RC thread until both async and sync actions will be executed.
--  This means that finalizers should be asynchronous for the additonal safety,
--  see 'm0asynchronous_'.
