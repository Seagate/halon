          -- imeta pool. Currently there is no marker on disks to distinguish
          -- which pool they should be in, however, so if these are created
          -- before the update then they get added to the IO pool. The correct
          -- solution will involve proper support for multiple pools and
          -- multiple types of pools. In the meantime, creating these fake
          -- devices later works.
