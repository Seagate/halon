-- Notably, this means that only process start logic that users should
-- concern themselves with is:
--
-- * Do we want to (re)start the process?
-- * Is halon:m0d up and running on the node?
-- * What is the result of the job?

-- a timeout.

-- verify process doesn't enter unexpected state, that node remains
-- online, that cluster remains online. Basically we have little
-- resilence towards cluster state changing after we have made initial
-- checks at start of the job.
