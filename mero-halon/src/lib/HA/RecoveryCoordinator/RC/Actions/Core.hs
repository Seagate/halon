-- Sometimes message may be wanted by many rules, in that case, it's not correct to
-- acknowledge message processing until all rules have processed message. In order to
-- solve that 'todo'/'done' framework was added. It allows marking message as needed
-- by the rule such message will be acknowledged only when all interested rules have
-- processed that message.
--
-- Currently there is a caveat because of possible race condition between rule marking
-- message as 'done' and another rule that is marking message as 'todo'. In order to
-- partially remove this race following rule was introduced:
--   * Message is acknowledged if no rule is interested in message (all rules that call
--     'todo' called 'done' also) and there were enough steps done, currently 10.
--
-- This means that race is still possible and message can be already acknowledged if
-- another rule read have to big gap befoe starting work with message.

-- process this message before current rule will call 'done'.
