-- $logging
--
-- The new logging framework is designed to make logging simpler for the
-- developer whilst giving much more information to the debugger. In order
-- to support this, here are some guidelines for logging.
--
-- The two most important functions in this module are 'tagContext' and
-- 'rcLog'', in that order. Tagging contexts (see '$context') is used to
-- associate data with logging statements. In general, where a rule concerns
-- some particular part of the cluster, or some configuration entity, these
-- should be attached to the relevant context (usually SM or Phase) using
-- 'tagContext'. This ensures that this information is available to any
-- logging calls made, and removes the need to encode these into message
-- strings.
--
-- 'rcLog' or 'rcLog'' should then be used to provide information about what's
-- happening. It is overloaded using the 'UserLoggable' class to support
-- logging of multiple types; in particular, there is support for logging
-- '[(String, String)]' in order to directly capture key-value information.
-- The need to perform string manipulation should be reduced; if you find
-- yourself using it, consider whether logging an 'Environment' or using
-- 'tagContext' would be better.
--
-- * Local contexts
--
-- Local contexts can be used to attach information to a block of log
-- statements. When using local contexts, the 'rcLog' call should be used in
-- place of 'rcLog'', since this call picks up on established local contexts.

-- | Simple class which lets us log basic types more easily. This allows the
--   user to just log "things" whilst constructing sensible types for logging,
--   rather than stringifying.
class UserLoggable a where
  toUserEvent :: a -> UserEvent

instance UserLoggable String where
  toUserEvent = Message

instance UserLoggable Environment where
  toUserEvent = Env

instance UserLoggable [(String, String)] where
  toUserEvent = Env . Map.fromList

instance UserLoggable (String, String) where
  toUserEvent = Env . Map.fromList . (:[])

-- $contexts
--
-- Contexts are used to associate data to multiple logging statements.
-- Fundamental to the use of contexts are two ideas:
--
-- - Tags are items of data which will be associated with any logging
--   statement made within the given context.
-- - Contexts delineate the set of messages which will be associated with
--   that context's tags.
--
-- There are currently four different contexts:
-- - Rule contexts associate tags with any log statement made in any instance of
--   the current rule. Their only likely use case is where some initial state
--   of the rule may be set on RC up, and we wish to associate this.
-- - SM contexts are the most common. The SM context associates tags with any
--   log statement made within the given instance of the rule. This context is
--   useful where a rule may fork and deal with a particular part of the
--   cluster - a node, say, or a disk.
-- - Phase contexts associate tags with messages in the current phase of the
--   SM.
-- - Local contexts can be used to establish a block within which any log
--   messages may be associated with tags. For example:
--   @
--     Left (StorageDevice.AnotherInSlot asdev) -> do
--    Log.withLocalContext' $ do
--      Log.tagLocalContext asdev Nothing
--      Log.tagLocalContext [("location"::String, show sdev_loc)] Nothing
--      Log.rcLog Log.ERROR
--        ("Insertion in a slot where previous device was inserted - removing old device.":: String)
--      StorageDevice.ejectFrom asdev sdev_loc
--      notify $ DriveRemoved uuid node sdev_loc asdev mis_powered
--   @
--
-- Tags typically fall into two categories:
-- - Entities in the resource graph, such as nodes and Mero conf objects.
-- - General strings and key-value string pairs.
--
-- Which things can be used to tag contexts is determined by the 'Taggable'
-- class. If you find yourself repeatedly tagging contexts with a particular
-- type, consider adding it as a potential 'HA.RecoveryCoordinator.Log.Scope'
-- and adding a 'Taggable' instance rather than using 'show'.

-- | Hidden type to collect local contexts implicitly.
newtype LocalContext = LocalContext {unLocalContext :: [UUID]}

-- | 'LocalContext' with no information.

  return res

-- | Establishes an implicit local context ex nihilo; thus this can be used
--   without any existing contexts in scope.
--   Note that nesting calls to 'withLocalContext'' will not work. However,
--   'withLocalContext' can safely be nested within 'withLocalContext''

-- | Log a user loggable event to the decision log framework.
--
--   'rcLog' (or its non-local context sensitive analogue, 'rcLog''), should
--   be the go-to stop for most logging. It has a number of benefits over
--   'phaseLog':
--   - Messages will be associated with any tags established in its contexts.
--   - Source location will be recorded for easier debugging.
--   - Log levels may be used for filtering.
--   - Key-value pairs may be logged directly without the need for formatting
--     into a single string, or using multiple log calls.
