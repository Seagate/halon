-- | Announce that we're not going to wait for any more phases with
-- this dispatcher. It's useful because it allows following scenario:
--
-- @
--  dispatcher <- 'mkDispatcher'
--  normal_run <- 'phaseHandle' "normal_run"
--  abort <- 'phaseHandle' "abort"
--  more_work <- 'phaseHandle' more_work
--
-- 'setPhase' normal_run $ \Foo -> do
--   …
--   -- We have completed all the expected work for this dispatcher
--   -- and want to proceed to success phase.
--   'waitClear'
--
-- 'setPhase' abort $ \Abort -> do
--   -- Do something exceptional
--   …
--   continue more_work
--
-- …
--
-- 'directly' run_dispatcher $ do
--   'waitFor' normal_run
--   'waitFor' abort_message
--   'onTimeout' t more_work
--   'onSuccess' more_work
--   'continue' dispatcher
--
-- 'directly' more_work $ …
--
-- 'start' run_dispatcher
-- @
--
-- With this approach, we can have extra phases to wait for and have
-- any of the phases decide that the work is over. In the example
-- above, @normal_run@ completes its work and determines we no longer
-- want to wait for @abort@ but has no explicit knowledge of it or any
-- other phases we may be waiting for.
--
-- Another use for 'waitClear' is if we want to re-use the dispatcher
-- but we're unsure or don't care how its last use ended. From the
-- example above, we have ran the dispatcher and we are now in
-- @more_work@: we could have gotten here either from @normal_run@ or
-- from @abort_message@. If we came from @abort_message@, we way well
-- still have @normal_run@ in the dispatcher state. If @more_work@
-- wants to use the dispatcher, perhaps for something completely
-- different, 'waitClear' can assure that such a potentially-unwanted
-- phase does not stick around.
waitClear :: forall a l. (Application a, FldDispatch ∈ l)
          => PhaseM a (FieldRec l) ()
waitClear = modify Local $ rlens fldDispatch . rfield . waitPhases .~ []

-- | Create the phase driving the dispatcher. Once you have populated
-- dispatcher fields (with 'waitFor' and similar helpers in this
-- module), you can start the dispatcher by running the phase provided
-- by 'mkDispatcher'. Typical use-case:
--
-- @
-- someRule :: 'Definitions' 'RC' ()
-- someRule = 'define' "someRule" $ do
--   rule_init <- 'phaseHandle' "rule_init"
--   worker <- 'phaseHandle' "worker"
--   worker_timed_out <- 'phaseHandle' "worker_timed_out"
--   worker_finished <- 'phaseHandle' "worker_finished"
--   dispatch <- 'mkDispatcher'
--
--  directly rule_init $ do
--    -- Do some stuff
--    'waitFor' worker
--    'onTimeout' 10 worker_timed_out
--    'onSuccess' worker_finished
--    'continue' dispatch
--
--  'setPhase' worker $ \_ -> …
--  'directly' worker_timed_out $ …
--  'directly' worker_finished $ …
--
--  'start' rule_init (args rule_init)
--  where
--    args start_ph = 'fldDispatch' '=:' 'Dispatch' [] start_ph 'Nothing'
-- @
--
-- [Dev note: @time_out_wrapper@] This wrapper is necessary to support
-- 'timeout' in phases passed to 'onTimeout'. Consider:
--
--     > 'onTimeout' 10 boring_phase
--     > 'onTimeout' 10 ('timeout' 20 foo)
--
--     In first case, the user would expect boring_phase to possibly fire
--     after 10 seconds. In second case however two things could happen:
--
--     * We try to fire @foo@ after 30 seconds.
--     * After 10 seconds we commit to possibly firing @foo@ after 20 seconds.
--
--     The second option is picked because it allows the user to use
--     'timeout' without worrying if underlying implementation uses
--     'timeout' and what will CEP do in this case.
