  -- ^ How many times we want to retry disk reset procedure before giving up.
  , _hv_process_configure_timeout :: !Int

  -- be timed out. This includes time spent waiting on @mero-mkfs@.
  , _hv_process_start_cmd_timeout :: !Int
  -- ^ How many seconds to wait for a process start command to return.
  -- Note that this is not the same as the time we should wait for a
  -- process to successfully start, for that see
  -- '_hv_process_start_timeout'. For configuration timeout
  -- (@mero-mkfs@ &c.) see '_hv_process_configure_timeout'.

  -- process start command has completed. For the timeout pertaining
  -- to the timeout of the start command itself, see

  -- ^ How many seconds should we allow for a drive to sit in transient state

  -- ^ How many seconds should the node monitor angel wait without
  -- receiving any commands and deciding to send heartbeat to

  , _hv_mero_workers_allowed :: !Bool
  -- ^ Whether to run allow running of mero workers. It may happen
  -- we're on a system where it's not possible to actually run mero
  -- but some actions which require it are performed. This flag
  -- indicates to those functions that they should do ‘something else’
  -- instead of starting the mero worker and performing the task. What
  -- this is depends on the function itself: it does not fundamentally
  -- prevent calls to initialize the workers.
  --
  -- This is mainly used for testing of components that don't rely on
  -- the result of the tasks normally performed by mero workers for
  -- main functionality. You probably __never__ want to set this on an
  -- actual deployment.
  , _hv_disable_smart_checks :: !Bool
  -- ^ Disable smart tests of the disks. If smart test is disabled
  -- all calls to smart test automatically successful.
  , _hv_service_stop_timeout :: !Int
  -- ^ How long to wait for a service to stop (perform teardown and
  -- exit) before the calling rule decides to stop waiting for result.

  -- ^ Minimum number of drives we would expect to see failing in the case of
  --   an expander reset.
  , _hv_expander_reset_reset_timeout :: !Int
  -- ^ Number of seconds to wait following an inferred expander reset for drives
  --   to come back online before attempting to reset them.
  , _hv_notification_timeout :: !Int
  -- ^ Number of seconds to wait for all notifications to be acknowledged by
  --   the system (or for them to be cancelled due to process failure).
  --   This should be lower than any timeout which waits (in a rule) for all
  --   notifications to be acknowledged.
  , _hv_notification_aggr_delay :: !Int
  -- ^ How long to wait for a new notification to add into the aggregation
  --   (in ms).

  -- ^ How long to aggregate notifications before sending them (in ms).
  , _hv_failed_notification_fails_process :: !Bool

  --   send a notification to it. Generally we want this, but it can sometimes
  --   cause problems.

  -- ^ How many times to ask for the status of SNS operation before giving up
  --   and retrying.
  , _hv_sns_operation_retry_attempts :: !Int
  -- ^ How many attempts to execute SNS operation to make before giving up
