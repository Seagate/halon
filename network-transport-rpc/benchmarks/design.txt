== Network transport benchmark design ==

The goal is testing the scalability of the transport network layer on parsci
cluster.


The benchmark will have the following parameters:
 * amount of machines
 * amount of connections per machine
 * amount of data to send through each connection

== Benchmark phases ==

=== Phase I ===

A process creates one thread per connection and one endpoint.

The processes in each machine exchange completion messages when they are done
creating endpoints. Then threads start creating connections. And then they
exchange completion messages again.


=== Phase II ===

Each thread starts sending data through its connection.

When processes finish sending data they exchange completion messages.


=== Phase III ===

Each process reports the time taken by phase II and terminates.


== Example scenario ==

We have 20 machines and I would like to test up to 1000 threads
distributed on them, more if possible. So we have 50 threads per
machine.

Each thread will establish a connection. So each machine should
have some 50 connections to each of the other 19 machines.

If the switch can handle 3.3 GB/s this means each thread should be
able to send 35 KB/s on each connection.
