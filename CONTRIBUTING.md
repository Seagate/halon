# Contributing

Contributions are most welcome.

When reviewing pull requests we usually check that tests still pass
 
	make clean
	make build

and that the code follows our [style guide]. More information on using the
build system can be found in the [README.md](README.md) file.

We have a [review guide] that also could help spotting issues in the code.

When debugging halon, the [debugging facilities] of distributed-process could
be helpful.
