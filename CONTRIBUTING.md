# Contributing

Contributions are most welcome.

Before submitting pull requests for review we usually check that tests
still pass:
 
	stack test

and that the code follows our [style guide]. More information on using
the build system can be found in the [README.md](README.md) file.

We have a [review checklist] that helps spotting issues in the code.

When debugging halon, the [debugging facilities] of the
`distributed-process` package can be helpful.
